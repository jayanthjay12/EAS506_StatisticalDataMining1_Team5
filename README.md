## Abstract

Every year there is significant growth regarding online travel. The majority of contributions to online travel come from the hotel industry. Advance reservation for hotels is a wonderful solution but online cancellation of booking is currently one of the problems that hotel management systems are facing. It's a risk for hotels when an advance reservation gets cancelled at the last minute, the hotel cannot do much but give the room at a lesser price or even face a total loss in case of no further booking. So the opportunity to earn some higher revenue is lost. 

Therefore, there is an opportunity for a prediction model to fill this gap and help hotels minimize profit loss. Our aim is to find a solution that allows hotels to accurately predict the demand and help them overcome revenue issues with the cancellation and improve their inventory allocation procedures by evaluating and analyzing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and AdaBoost.
